Hi, I’m Virginia, a UX analyst with a background in design and a focus in user research. I have
developed a creative eye from my previous experience as a graphic designer. With my past
experience in developing visual design experiences for users on the consumer facing end, it
allowed me to empathize with users and tell a story through branding. I have a knack for
identifying poor user experience and a creating strategy to improve them. With my formal
training in UX design, I will apply my methodology, design process and research to help users
with their pain points and achieve their goals. I will be an invaluable member to your team as a
well rounded creative problem solver with has a strong curiosity in human behavior. I look
forward to creating a positive impact for global audiences by creating meaningful experiences.
