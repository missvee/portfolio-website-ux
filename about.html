<h2>About</h2>
<div>
     <body>
A creative problem solver with a curiosity in human behavior. I love working with people and understanding what makes them tick. With my background in design, I have a knack for identifying poor user experience. My mission is to create meaningful experiences for a global audience.
<p>
A global citizen with awareness of multiple cultures. Originally from New York City, but I have called Copenhagen and San Francisco, home. I speak 4 languages; English, Cantonese, Spanish and Danish.
<p>
A world traveler who has a thirst for adventure. Aside from user experience, traveling is one of my biggest passions. I love exploring new countries, learning about people from all around the world and picking up new languages. I have explored 39 countries (and counting) and have lived in 2.
